# About

Replit Migrator is a tool to autonomously download all Repls from the online code collaboration platform Repl.it.  

This app was created to be my ICS4U (Grade 12 Computer Science) final project.

Web scraping is technically against Repl.it's TOS, so I'll probably private this repository or at least hide the scraping code once it has been evaluated.

Also see the repository for the database server [here](https://github.com/BrianZhang1/Replit-Migrator-Server).


# How to Use

1. Download/clone the project.
2. Navigate to the top level directory in this project (`Replit-Migrator/`)
3. Download dependencies from `requirements.txt` (optionally, create a virtual environment).
4. Run the `start.py` script (ex. `python start.py`).
